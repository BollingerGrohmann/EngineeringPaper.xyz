                    EngineeringPaper.xyz's ability to solve systems of equations makes it a useful tool for analyzing statically indeterminate beams. With statically indeterminate beam problems, the redundant constraints result in addition equations that need to be satisfied in order to make the problem fully defined. This example EngineeringPaper.xyz sheet illustrates how to solve&hellip;
