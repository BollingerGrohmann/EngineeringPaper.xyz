<p>Welcome to EngineeringPaper.xyz! By using this software, you are agreeing to the following terms
  and conditions.
</p>

<br>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>
EngineeringPaper.xyz strives to protect user privacy. This is a free service that doesn't require you to 
create an account. All of the calculations you perform on EngineeringPaper.xyz are 
performed on your own computer and nothing you enter into your sheets is sent to our servers unless you save a sheet.
When you save a sheet, we only store the minimum amount of information required to run the service (see details below).
EngineeringPaper.xyz doesn't use cookies to track its users. 
</p>
<br>
<h4>No Warranty</h4>
<p>
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN 
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” 
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY 
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF 
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Privacy</h4>
<p>
In order to keep this service running smoothly, EngineeringPaper.xyz uses
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/">Cloudflare's privacy protecting analytics service</a>
to collect usage statistics. This analytics service does not use cookies to track users and does not store any personal information.
</p>
<p>
The only time personal information is collected is when you use the "Get Shareable Link" feature of this site. When creating a shareable 
link, your IP address is stored in a database along with 
the contents of the sheet that is uploaded. The reason we collect the IP address for uploaded sheets is 
to protect this free service from abuse. This database server is currently located in the United States. This data may be relocated
to other servers throughout the world once the data service is migrated to Cloudflare. Cloudflare automatically attempts to locate
data closest to the user to improve overall performance.
</p>
<br>
<h4>No Data Retention Guarantee</h4>
<p>
  Our goal is to store sheets uploaded to EngineeringPaper.xyz for the life of the service. However, we provide
  no guarantee to the accessibility of this data in the future. We reserve the right to shut down this 
  service at any time and for any reason without warning. We also reserve the right to delete any uploaded 
  sheet at any time, and for any reason, without warning.
