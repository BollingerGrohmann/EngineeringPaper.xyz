<h4>Privacy</h4>
<p>
EngineeringPaper strives to protect your privacy and only stores information relevant to any sheets that

the contents of the sheet that is uploaded. The reason we collect the IP address for uploaded sheets is

the IP address stored with uploaded sheets, this site does not track users and does not use cookies. 
If you don't use the "Get Shareable Link" feature, no information is stored on our servers, even if you 
view links shared by others.

  no guarantee to the accessibility of this data in the future. We reserve the right to shut down this
