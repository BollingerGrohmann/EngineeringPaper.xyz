<p>Welcome to EngineeringPaper.xyz! By using this software, you are agreeing to the following terms
  and conditions.
</p>

<br>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>
EngineeringPaper.xyz strives to protect user privacy. This is free and open source software that does not 
require you to create an account to use. All of the calculations you perform on EngineeringPaper.xyz are 
performed on your own computer and nothing you enter into your sheets is sent to our servers unless you create
a shareable link.
When you create a shareable link, we only store the minimum amount of information required to run the 
shareable link service (see details below).
EngineeringPaper.xyz does not use cookies to track its users. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
You have the option to save your sheets to your local drive. If you only save your sheets locally,
none of your data is ever sent to our servers.
</p>
<br>
<h4>No Warranty</h4>
<p>
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN 
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” 
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY 
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF 
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Privacy</h4>
<p>
In order to keep this service running smoothly, EngineeringPaper.xyz uses
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/">Cloudflare's privacy protecting analytics service</a>
to collect usage statistics. This analytics service does not use cookies to track users and does not store any personal information.
</p>
<p>
The only time personal information is collected is when you use the "Get Shareable Link" feature of this site. 
When creating a shareable link, your IP address is stored in a database along with 
the contents of the sheet that is uploaded. The reason we collect the IP address for uploaded sheets is 
to protect this free shareable link service from abuse. When creating a shareable link, your data is stored on Cloudflare's 
global network. Cloudflare automatically attempts to locate
data closest to the user to improve overall performance.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Saving your sheets locally avoids sending any of your data to our database.
</p>
<br>
<h4>No Data Retention Guarantee for Shareable Links</h4>
<p>
  Our goal is to store sheets using the shareable link feature for the life of the shareable link service.
  However, we provide no guarantee to the accessibility of shareable links in the future. We reserve the right
  to shut down the shareable link service at any time and for any reason without warning.
  We also reserve the right to delete any uploaded sheet at any time, and for any reason, without warning.
</p>
<br>
<p>
 To ensure future access to your sheets, be sure to save them locally (even if you have created a shareable link).
