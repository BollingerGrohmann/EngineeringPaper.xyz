<h4>New System Solve Cell Type Added to EngineeringPaper.xyz</h4>
<p>
   The way EngineeringPaper.xyz handles equation solving has been updated and
   improved by adding a System Solve Cell type. This change makes it possible to
   solve multiple systems of equations in a single sheet and makes it easier to
   choose a particular solution when there are multiple solutions. <strong
      >Existing sheets that make use of equation solving will need to be updated
      to use the new System Solve Cell. See this

      > sheet to see how to update your sheets that make use of the new System Solve
      Cell type.
   </strong> This change will also make it easier to add numerical equation solving
   in future versions of EngineeringPaper.xyz.
