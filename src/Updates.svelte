<h4>Plotting Improvements</h4>
<p>
   Many improvements have been made to plotting in EngineeringPaper.xyz. The biggest new feature 
   is the "Copy Data" button that copies all of the plot data to the clipboard where you can 
   then paste it into Excel, Google Sheets, or Numbers. Support for log scaling of the x and/or y axes 
   has also been added. Finally, an insert plot cell button has been added to make it simpler to 
   create a plot. See the <a href="https://engineeringpaper.xyz/MNsS9tjtLLzcBTgTNboDiz" target="_blank">
   plotting and function tutorial</a> to try out these new features.

<h4>Numerical System Solving Capability Added to System Solve Cells</h4>
<p>
   EngineeringPaper.xyz now supports numerically solving equations and systems
   of equations in situations where the symbolic solver may not be able to find an exact
   solution. See the
   <a href="https://engineeringpaper.xyz/DeP4bqfF2H5VbRJz3Nd9Re" target="_blank"> 
      updated equation solving tutorial</a>
   sheet to see how to use this new capability. There is also a short
   <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/ZMOhOT7sUR0" target="_blank">numerical solver tutorial video</a>
   available.

<h4>New System Solve Cell Type Added to EngineeringPaper.xyz</h4>
<p>
   The way EngineeringPaper.xyz handles equation solving has been updated and
   improved by adding a System Solve Cell type. This change makes it possible to
   solve multiple systems of equations in a single sheet and makes it easier to
   choose a particular solution when there are multiple solutions. <strong
      >Existing sheets that make use of equation solving will need to be updated
      to use the new System Solve Cell. See this

      > sheet to see how to update your sheets that make use of the new System Solve
      Cell type.
   </strong> This change will also make it easier to add numerical equation solving
   in future versions of EngineeringPaper.xyz.

<h4>New Insert Sheet Feature Added to EngineeringPaper.xyz</h4>
<p>
   You can now easily insert other sheets and tables into your sheets to save
   typing. See this
   <a href="https://youtu.be/myWfj27rFcc" target="_blank">tutorial video</a> for
   a demo of this new feature.

<h4>New Table Cell Type Added to EngineeringPaper.xyz</h4>
<p>
   Table cells make it easy to compare multiple scenarios in a single sheet. For
   example, different materials or different boundary conditions can be defined
   in a table. See this
   <a href="https://youtu.be/xpQRVBi-36Y" target="_blank">tutorial video</a> for
   a demo of this new feature.
